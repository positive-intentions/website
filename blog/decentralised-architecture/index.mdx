## Data Storage and Networking

Our decentralized chat application takes a unique approach to data storage and networking, two critical components of any modern app. We've implemented innovative solutions that prioritize efficiency, security, and user privacy, setting our app apart from traditional centralized models. Let's explore how we handle these crucial aspects in a decentralized manner.

## Data Storage

Our app leverages IndexedDB for robust, client-side data storage directly in the browser. This choice offers several advantages over traditional options like cookies or local storage:

- **High Capacity**: IndexedDB can handle large volumes of data, far exceeding the limitations of other browser storage methods.
- **Complex Data Structures**: It supports storing and querying sophisticated data types, including files, blobs, and nested objects.
- **Asynchronous Operations**: IndexedDB's non-blocking, asynchronous API ensures smooth performance, even when dealing with substantial datasets.
- **Offline Functionality**: By storing data locally, our app can function without an internet connection, syncing changes when connectivity is restored.
- **Enhanced Privacy**: User data remains on their device, reducing exposure to potential breaches and unauthorized access.
- **Decentralized Architecture**: Local storage aligns with our goal of minimizing reliance on central servers, giving users more control over their data.

By utilizing IndexedDB, we create a foundation for a truly decentralized chat experience, where user privacy and data ownership are paramount.

## Networking

For networking, our app uses PeerJS-server as a connection broker to establish WebRTC connections between peers.

- **Direct Peer-to-Peer** : WebRTC, provided by the browser, enables real-time communication between peers. This allows two users to connect directly and exchange data with minimal latency.
- **Efficient Routing** : Once a connection is established, data is sent via the shortest possible network route, enhancing speed and efficiency.
- **Multiple Connections** : Browsers can handle multiple WebRTC connections simultaneously, though the number of connections can vary depending on the device and network capabilities.

PeerJS-server helps in the initial connection setup by acting as a signaling server. It facilitates the exchange of connection information between peers, enabling them to establish a direct WebRTC connection.

Our chat application achieves a high level of decentralization by utilizing two key technologies: IndexedDB for data storage and WebRTC with PeerJS-server for networking. This combination ensures that user data remains private and secure on their own devices, while enabling efficient and reliable peer-to-peer connections. By implementing these components, we're redefining what it means for an app to be truly self-hosted and decentralized, offering users unprecedented control over their data and communications.

# Static Distribution and Deployment

Our application is fundamentally a collection of static files, offering exceptional portability and ease of distribution. We utilize AWS services, specifically S3 for storage and CloudFormation for infrastructure management, to deploy our app. This approach ensures efficient distribution through a Content Delivery Network (CDN) spanning multiple AWS servers, optimizing accessibility and performance for users across different geographical locations.

## AWS S3 and CloudFormation

- **AWS S3** : We host our app on AWS S3, a scalable storage service that allows us to serve static files reliably. S3 ensures that our app is always available and can handle large numbers of requests without performance degradation.
- **CloudFormation** : By using AWS CloudFormation, we automate the deployment process, managing our infrastructure as code. This makes it easy to replicate and manage our app’s deployment environment.

Hosting on S3 and using CloudFormation means our app benefits from AWS’s global CDN. This ensures that our static files are cached and served from servers closest to our users, reducing latency and improving load times.

## Offline Availability and Self-Hosting

We go a step further by providing users with the option to download a zip file of the app directly from within the app. This ensures that users can run the app locally without relying on our servers.

- **Direct from Index.html** : Unlike some other apps, our app is a pure JavaScript implementation, designed to run directly from the index.html file. Users can simply open this file in their browser and start using the app without needing a server.
- **Docker Option** : For users who prefer or require a server setup, we offer a Docker configuration. This allows the app to be run in a containerized environment, providing flexibility and ease of deployment for different use cases.

## Unminified Code for Transparency

We believe in transparency and accessibility. Therefore, we run the app as unminified code. This has several advantages:

- **Ease of Download** : Users can download the entire app using simple browser commands like Ctrl/Cmd+S.
- **Transparency** : By providing unminified code, we ensure that users can inspect and understand the code they are running. This fosters trust and allows for easier customization and debugging.

By distributing our app as static files and offering multiple ways to run it, we ensure that users have maximum flexibility and control. Whether using AWS’s robust infrastructure or running the app locally, our approach embodies the principles of decentralization and user empowerment.

# Webpack 5 Module Federation

Our application harnesses the power of Webpack 5's Module Federation feature to implement a sophisticated microfrontend architecture. This innovative approach enables us to modularize our application into distinct, independently deployable units, significantly enhancing maintainability, development efficiency, and scalability. By breaking down the monolithic structure into smaller, more manageable pieces, we can develop and update different parts of the application independently, reducing complexity and potential conflicts.

This modular design not only streamlines our development process but also allows for greater flexibility in terms of technology choices and team autonomy. Each microfrontend can be developed, tested, and deployed independently, fostering a more agile development cycle.

We invite you to explore our open-source implementation and contribute to its evolution. You can find our frontend base repository [here](https://github.com/positive-intentions/frontend-base), which serves as the foundation for our modular architecture.

## Current Implementation

We have used Webpack 5 Module Federation to build the chat application, which you can find [here]([https://github.com/positive-intentions/chat](https://github.com/positive-intentions/chat)). Additionally, we have created a federated module for cryptography that can be imported at runtime, available [here]([https://github.com/positive-intentions/cryptography](https://github.com/positive-intentions/cryptography)). Our current setup is straightforward, allowing us to dynamically load different parts of the application as needed. This modular approach provides flexibility and efficiency in how we develop and deploy our app.

# Future Enhancements

We plan to further decompose the application into separate microfrontends, each responsible for a specific aspect of the app. This will not only simplify maintenance but also enhance documentation and development processes for individual components.

Planned Modules:

1. **UI Components** : A collection of reusable UI components that can be shared across different parts of the application, promoting consistency and reducing duplication.
2. **P2P Framework** : The core framework for peer-to-peer networking, facilitating real-time communication between users.
3. **State Management** : This module will manage the application’s state, ensuring efficient data handling and synchronization across different components and peers.
4. **Permission Manager** : A dedicated module for managing user permissions and access control, enhancing security and user management.
