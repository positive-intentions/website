# Welcome
<NLevelAnalytics />

Welcome to positive-intentions, the new kid on the block in digital chat. Our app is all about safe, private chats that you can access easily from your web browser.

If you're someone who likes the idea of a secure, web-based chat that's simple to use, you're in the right place.

Unlike a lot of chat apps, we don't rely on big, complex backend servers. We use modern browser tech and the peerjs-server to make our app work. This means that when you chat with someone, it's a direct line between you and them - no one else in between.

The real standout of positive-intentions is that it lives on the web. Yes, there are some trade-offs, but we think they're worth it. With our app, you can get chatting instantly, no matter what browser or operating system you use. And all without giving up any cool features.

The magic behind positive-intentions is our unique peer-to-peer (P2P) architecture. We built this ourselves to power our app and make all its nifty features possible.

We've put a lot of heart into building positive-intentions. We hope it will help you and lots of others chat safely with friends, family, and anyone else you want to connect with.

It's worth noting that positive-intentions is a work in progress. We're still working on some features, and there will be more exciting changes in the pipeline. So stay tuned!
