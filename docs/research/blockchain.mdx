# Blockchain Technology in positive-intentions
<NLevelAnalytics />

At positive-intentions, we're committed to providing the most secure and reliable chat experience. One of the ways we're achieving this is through the development of an internal, JavaScript-based blockchain system. It's important to note that our use of blockchain technology is wholly separate from currencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum, and is solely for enhancing our chat app's functionality.

## Decentralized Data Storage

The core purpose of our blockchain implementation is to facilitate decentralized data storage. By utilizing blockchain technology, we're able to create a data system that's not just immutable and verifiable, but can also serve as a historical record to rebuild data states. This makes for a highly secure and transparent way of managing user data.

## Manage Group Conversations

Beyond its data storage capabilities, our blockchain system also offers advantages for managing group conversations. Messages stored on the blockchain allow for easier management of group chats, improving user experience.

## Offline Messaging

Another groundbreaking feature that our blockchain system can provide is the potential for offline messaging. With the use of our blockchain, it might be possible for users to receive messages even when one of the peers is offline, ensuring continuous communication.

## Efficient and Compact

We're aware that the use of blockchain can lead to large data sizes. However, rest assured that we're diligently working on solutions to reduce the size of the blockchain without compromising its functionality or security. 

Our blockchain technology is an exciting development that we believe will significantly enhance the user experience in positive-intentions, providing a seamless, secure, and innovative communication platform.

## Trust-Based Connection

At positive-intentions, the trust between users is a critical aspect of our blockchain implementation. We understand the potential implications and vulnerabilities that might arise from a decentralized approach. Thus, we always encourage users to connect with peers they trust.

## Manipulation of Records

We are designing our blockchain system to give users complete access and control over their data. However, this also means that peers could potentially manipulate their copy of the chain. We're conscious of this and are committed to developing countermeasures for such scenarios. This is yet another reason why it's vital for users to connect with trusted peers.

## The Truth of Blockchains

Given our unique design considerations, we have chosen to view all shared blockchains as "truth." The alternative would be to implement an array of objects shared between peers, which brings its own set of challenges. While we are aware of the potential pitfalls of our current approach, we are constantly working on improvements and new ways to ensure the security and integrity of our blockchain implementation.

## Note

We're fully aware that our blockchain technology, like all things, isn't perfect and is still a work in progress. We're committed to constantly improving it and are open to community feedback to make it better. The power of positive-intentions lies in its community, and we're grateful for all the input and trust you've placed in us!
