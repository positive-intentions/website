# Exploring Augmented Reality
<NLevelAnalytics />

Innovation and creativity drive us at positive-intentions, and we're always open to exploring "out-of-the-box" ideas that can redefine how people communicate. One such exciting prospect we're currently investigating is the integration of Augmented Reality (AR) into our P2P communication system.

## A Virtual World

Imagine being able to interact with your peers not just through text, voice, or video, but in a fully immersive virtual world. This possibility is what we aim to explore with the integration of AR. With our comprehensive P2P system as a strong base, we're eager to see how we can build upon this to create more enriching and engaging communication experiences.

## Video Streams in a 3D Environment

We're intrigued by the potential of integrating video streams from calls directly into a 3D environment, essentially allowing you to "step into" a conversation with your peers. This integration could elevate the way we perceive and engage in online communication, moving beyond traditional screen-bound interactions.

## Current Research

Currently, we're looking into using Babylon.js, a powerful, feature-rich 3D engine, to facilitate our exploration into AR. With Babylon.js, it's possible to incorporate video textures into 3D environments, as detailed in their [documentation](https://doc.babylonjs.com/features/featuresDeepDive/materials/using/videoTexture).

## Exciting Possibilities

Though this idea is still in its investigative phase, we're excited about the possibilities it presents. Imagine meeting with friends, family, or colleagues in a virtual world, experiencing new dimensions of interaction and communication. This is the kind of future we're working towards at positive-intentions, and we're thrilled to have you on this journey with us.
