Connecting with peers is at the heart of our chat app experience. We've designed a seamless process that ensures your privacy and security while enabling meaningful connections:

- **PeerJS and WebRTC:** positive-intentions utilizes PeerJS and WebRTC technologies to facilitate peer-to-peer connections. PeerJS simplifies the process of establishing connections between users' browsers, while WebRTC enables real-time communication.

- **Connection Data Sharing:** You have the flexibility to share your connection data with peers using various methods like other chat apps, email, SMS, and more. The choice is yours!

- **QR Code Connectivity:** For added convenience, our app can generate, display, and scan QR codes for peer connections. This quick method ensures a hassle-free connection setup.

- **Trust and Security:** Always exercise caution when sharing your connection data. Only share it with individuals you trust to maintain a secure communication environment.

## Peer Profile

Getting to know your peers is essential for effective communication. Here's what you can expect from a peer's profile:

- **Default Display Name:** When you connect with a peer, their default display name is shown to you. This helps you recognize your peers in conversations.

- **Custom Display Name:** You have the option to personalize the display name of your peers on your instance of the app. This customized name will be displayed for you during interactions.

## Privacy and Security

We prioritize your privacy and security in every peer connection:

- **Secure First-Time Connection:** The first-time connection to a peer is a critical step for security. During this initial contact, our app establishes public-key and symmetric-key encryption. This ensures that your future communications are protected and that you're indeed communicating with the intended user.

- **Safety Tips:** When interacting with peers, remember to be cautious and only connect with individuals you trust. Our app offers a secure environment, but your diligence in choosing whom you communicate with is equally important.
