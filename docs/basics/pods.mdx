## What Are Pods?

Think of pods as your shared communication hubs within positive-intentions. A pod is a unit of connection that allows users to create a collaborative environment for conversations and content sharing. Pods are designed to offer an enhanced way to connect and engage with others:

- **Creating Pods:** With positive-intentions, you have the power to create and manage pods. These pods act as spaces where you and your connected peers can come together to chat and share.

## Interaction within Pods

Within a pod, the possibilities are endless:

- **Group Conversations:** Pods enable group conversations where you can chat with multiple peers simultaneously. It's like being in a virtual room where everyone can participate.

- **Message Sharing:** Exchange messages seamlessly with your pod members. Stay connected, informed, and engaged in ongoing discussions.

- **File Sharing:** Need to share images, documents, or media? Pods make it easy to share files with your connected peers, promoting collaborative work and sharing memories.

## Get Started with Pods

Getting started with pods is simple:

1. **Create a Pod:** Use positive-intentions to create your own pod. Think of it as setting up your own virtual gathering space.

2. **Invite Peers:** Invite your friends, colleagues, or anyone you want to connect with to join your pod.

3. **Start Interacting:** Once your pod is up and running, start chatting, sharing messages, and exchanging files within the shared environment.

## Pods: A New Way to Connect

At positive-intentions, we believe that pods redefine the way you connect and communicate:

- Collaborative Environment: Pods offer a collaborative space where you can interact, engage, and work together seamlessly.

- Rich Conversations: Share thoughts, ideas, and media with your pod members, creating a vibrant communication experience.

- Personalized Interaction: Pods allow you to connect with peers based on shared interests, projects, or goals.
