# Getting Started with positive-intentions

Welcome to positive-intentions, your secure and private peer-to-peer chat application. Here's how to get started and make the most of our unique features.

## Setting Up Your Profile

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>

</div>

1. **Choose a Username**: Select a username that represents you in the chat environment.

2. **Add an Avatar**: Personalize your profile by uploading an avatar image.

3. **Create Your Crypto Signature**: 
   - You'll be presented with a canvas where you can draw or write.
   - This input serves as user-generated entropy, enhancing our app's cryptographic capabilities.
   - Your signature adds an extra layer of randomness to our security measures.

4. **Select Your Connection ID Scheme**: Choose how you want your connection ID to be generated:
   - Random String: A completely random alphanumeric string
   - Animals: Your ID will be based on animal names
   - Countries: Your ID will use country names
   - Months: Your ID will incorporate month names

5. **Select Peerjs-server**: the default peerjs-server is a great way to get started, but you can also use your own and specify the URL.
