## Creating a Profile

Getting started is a breeze. Follow these steps to set up your profile:

1. **Automatic User ID:** Your app generates a unique and cryptographically secure ID for you to connect and identify yourself. This ensures a secure and private experience.

2. **Read and Accept Terms:** Before you can use the connection features, we ask that you read and agree to our terms and conditions. Your security and privacy are important to us.

3. **Choose a Username:** Set a username that represents you. It's how your friends will recognize you in chats.

4. **Add a Profile Picture:** Make your profile come to life by adding a profile picture. Click on your default image and upload a picture that reflects your personality.

5. **App Preferences:** Customize your app preferences, including notification settings, to match your communication style.

## Profile Settings

Tailor your chat experience with these customizable settings:

- **Username:** You can change your username at any time to keep things fresh.

- **Profile Picture:** Update your profile picture whenever you like.

- **Connection ID:** Customize your connection ID in the Profile Settings. This ID helps you connect with others while maintaining your privacy.

- **App Preferences:** Adjust your notification settings and other app preferences to suit your preferences.

## Security Reminders

- **End-to-End Encryption:** Your messages are secure with end-to-end encryption, but remember that security also depends on whom you connect with. Only chat with people you trust.

- **Peer Trust:** Be cautious about connecting with peers you don't know. Stick to trusted contacts to ensure a safe chat environment.

- **Internet Safety:** Keep in mind that even with strong encryption, it's wise to avoid sharing sensitive information over the internet.
