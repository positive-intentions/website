# Total Control: Export and Import Your Data
<NLevelAnalytics />

At positive-intentions, we understand that your data belongs to you. We value your right to control, move, and manage your personal information. That's why we've built a straightforward export and import feature into our app, giving you total control over your data.

With just a few simple clicks, positive-intentions allows you to export all of your data at any time. This means you can create a backup of all your chats, video call history, and profile information whenever you feel the need. The export file is universally readable and transparent, ensuring you have a clear understanding of the data you're managing.

Similarly, our import feature allows you to restore your data quickly and easily. Moving to a new device? No problem. Just import your previously exported data, and you'll have your entire positive-intentions history, profile, and preferences back at your fingertips.

The ability to export and import your data isn't just a feature, it's a testament to our commitment to privacy and transparency. It means your information isn't locked away in a proprietary system, but fully accessible and movable according to your needs.

So chat, call, and connect, knowing you have complete autonomy over your data. That's the freedom and control positive-intentions offers.
