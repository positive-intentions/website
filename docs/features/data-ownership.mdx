# Your Data, Your Control: Local Data Ownership and Storage
<NLevelAnalytics />


In the digital age, data privacy and ownership are paramount. That's why positive-intentions has been designed with a unique approach to data storage: all your data is stored locally, right in your browser. No servers, no third-party databases, just you and your device.

When using positive-intentions, the storage provided by your browser becomes the home for your data. Every chat, every video call, all your information is kept safe and secure, on your own device. And if you ever need to clear your site data, there's no need for concern. We've got a quick and easy feature that allows you to download your profile data instantly. This means you can load it back whenever you like, or even move your data to a different computer.

Since we don't store any user data on our servers, the power is in your hands. Your data is only shared between you and your conversation partner — no one else. And because your data is managed internally by the app on your device, it stays where it should: with you.

Transparency is also a top priority for us. You can easily access all your data in a clear and easy-to-understand format. Just head over to the developer tools in your browser, and everything will be right there, just a click away.

So chat freely, connect deeply, and rest easy knowing that your data stays yours, right where it belongs — on positive-intentions.
