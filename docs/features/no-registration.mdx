# No Registration: Instant Chatting with Zero Hassle
<NLevelAnalytics />

At positive-intentions, we believe in giving you the freedom to chat and connect without unnecessary hoops to jump through. That's why we've designed positive-intentions with a no-registration feature, allowing you to get started immediately without any tedious sign-up process.

When you set up your profile on positive-intentions, we don't ask for personal details like email addresses or phone numbers. The details you provide are stored locally in your browser, similar to a cookie but capable of storing larger data, including images.

By using the innovative technologies of PeerJS and the PeerJS server, we establish a connection between you and your chat partner. Once connected, your profile data, which is stored locally and never on a server, is shared between you and your chat partner, enabling a rich, personalized chat experience.

This no-registration approach isn't just about convenience. It's also about ensuring you have control over your personal information. In an age where data privacy is a top concern, positive-intentions lets you enjoy the benefits of a chat app without the worry of your data being collected or misused.

But that's not all. This feature is perfect for those who value simplicity and speed. It eliminates the often tedious process of registration and verification, enabling you to get started with just a few clicks.

So, whether you're keen to maintain your privacy, or you simply want to dive straight into connecting with others, our no-registration feature is your ticket to immediate, hassle-free communication.

Get started with positive-intentions today, and experience the freedom of instant, secure, and personal chat.
